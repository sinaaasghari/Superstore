# Data Analysis on Superstore Sales Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the data from a superstore. It consists of four main sections:

1. **Data Warehouse Preparation**:
   - Preprocess and clean the data.
   - Design the data warehouse structure with Fact and Dimension tables.
   - Create keys and relationships between tables.
   - Import tables into Power BI and ensure correct relationships.

2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Investigate the impact of discounts on sales.
   - Divide the data into discount and non-discount groups.
   - Analyze the distribution of sold items in each group.
   - Perform statistical tests to determine if there is a significant difference between the groups.

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Task 1: Profit Estimation
     - Preprocess the data and select relevant features.
     - Train a model to predict the profit of a sold product.
     - Ensure the model is generalizable and avoids overfitting.

   - Task 2: Shipping Mode Prediction
     - Preprocess the data and select appropriate features.
     - Train a model to predict the shipping mode for each order.
     - Evaluate the model's performance.

4. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Import the preprocessed data into Power BI.
   - Design and create a dashboard with meaningful visualizations.
   - Provide recommendations for improving the business based on the analysis.
